# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
Customizable CNN written from only the standard library
A better explanation of the project is found in the Ritas-CNN repository.
The original idea is exactly the same however, this version is written in C and provides greater control.
One can change the number of filters, weights, stride size, input size, etc. based on their application.
A lot of work still needs to be done.
